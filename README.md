# SHINY-Visualitzation

This application is an automated reporting solution of different hospitals in Catalonia.  
Due to the fact before everything was manually reported, 
it was necessary to develope this app. 

It is shown the main cancerâ€™s metrics survival from different hospitals.
To start with in the first page it appears one descriptive about number of patients, 
patients's origin, type of treatment and a long etcetera.

Moreover, there is one survival's analysis with the table, 
observed survival plot, relative survival plot and also both of them together. 

The principal advantatge of this application is that has the same funcionalities 
as Tableau, howerver it is cost free tool. 

I can't share the project and neither the data because it's a sesitive data case.
