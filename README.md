# SHINY-Visualitzation

This applications is an automate reporting to members of diferent hospitals in Catalonia.  
Due to the fact before everything was manually reported, 
it was necessary to develope this solution. 

It's appear the main cancerâ€™s metrics survival from different hospitals.
To start with in the first page it appears one descriptive about number of patients, 
origin's patients, type of procediments that they used and etcetera.

Moreover, there are one survival's analysis with the table, 
observed survival plot and relative survival plot and also both of them together. 

I can't share the project and neither the data because it's a sensable data case. 

Warning: you need to download the video because the size it a litel bit big.
